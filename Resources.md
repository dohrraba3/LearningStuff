## Setup

### Text Editor Options
This is a program you are going to use A LOT. In order to create and edit code and not go crazy, neither TextEdit nor (shudder) Notepad will do--we need colors! We need smart indenting! Your text edior will be where you write and reason about your code. 

Find one that works for/interests you.

### Command Line
The command line (or "terminal") is the gateway to your computer's internals. It's a more direct and customizable way to do things that you'd usually do through a graphical user interface.

The command line can seem imposing and scary the first few times you're interacting with it. But: the two tools we're going to use the most as front end developers are the command line and a simple text editor, so we need to get comfortable with it.

### Create a GitHub Account
GitHub is the industry's standard code host. Use it to store your code in its online repositories and use it for collaboration, versioning, static website hosting and much more! Some notes:
* Pick a username easy to remember and make your avatar a picture of yourself 

- [ ] [GitHub's Website](https://github.com)

_why is this important?_  Because you want to be able to show what you've done. Also storing code in GitHub will be easy as gh-pages will let you host free static sites to show off live demos of your website/projects that you build. 

### Git/GitHub
Code needs to live somewhere that isn't your computer. It needs to have a history, and you will need to collaborate with others. Required for the working world.
